# ArcadeMachine
 SFASU Computer Science Club's communal repository used for collaboration on the arcade machine!

# space_invaders
The space_invaders folder holds all the necessary files to run the space invaders game.
This includes:
    1. the "assets" folder which includes the images used by the code.
    2. "space_invaders.py" which holds all the code for the game.

This is meant to be used as a reference for the following:
    1. taking input from keyboard
    2. taking in an image and using it in your game

# controller_test
The controller_test folder has two files:
    1. "main.py" which contains a bare bones program for taking input in from a joystick.
        It contains an abundance of comments to help you gain a better understanding of
        what each line in the program does and help you learn how to read pygame code.
    2. "main_no_comments.py" which is the same code as main.py but with no comments.

# pong
The pong folder contains the rough draft of Jorge's and April's pong game. This code may
be referenced, however, since it was our first time coding a game, I recommend looking at
the two options above before this code.

    1. Input is taken from a SINGLE xbox controller and the left/right joysticks are used
       to control player 1/player 2 respectively. This can also be referenced if you are
       having trouble understanding how to implement motion or take input from a joystick.
